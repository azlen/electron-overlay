# Electron Overlay Demo

This is a basic demo in creating an invisible overlay using electron. I've only tested on linux but hopefully it works cross-platform.

## Todo

[] Support multi-screen displays (gets especially tricky if you want to move things from one screen to another seamlessly?)
[] Prevent from being displayed in app-switcher (cmd+tab / ctrl+tab)
